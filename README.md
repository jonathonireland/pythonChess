<p>This game development started in December of 2023 because of an interest I have in learning Python. It quickly became an obsession in completing the tutorials below:</p>

</ol>

<h2>Working through development plans.</h2>
<p>After Following the tutorials above, I started adding some more features including listing out moves next to the pieces that were captured throughout the games and database tables for games, moves, captures, checks, pawn promotions, and castlings.</p>
