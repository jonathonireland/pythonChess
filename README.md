<p>This game development started in December of 2023 because of an interest I have in learning Python. It quickly became an obsession in completing the tutorials below:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-e0jk4I938&t=7481s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-e0jk4I938&t=7481s</a></li>

</ol>
<p>Those two tutorials were a great foundation to begin experimentation and learning in Python. Once they were completed, I began to start coding ideas of my own for the game, and I still am developing new features.</p>
<h2>Working through development plans.</h2>
<p>I started adding some more features which include: </p>
<ul>
<li>listing out the moves made through the game next to the pieces that were captured</li> 
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "games" table for each game</li>
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "gameMoves" table for each move</li>
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "gameCaptures" table for each capture</li> 
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "gameChecks" table for each check</li>
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "gamePromotions" table for each pawn promotion</li>
<li>adding (and inserting into) a "gameCastling" table for each castle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development plans:</h3>

<li>Improve Readme file 100X over</li>
<li>Clean up code.</li>
<li>Record game winners to a table (moves? or it's own table).</li>
<li>Add more features based on database connection.</li>
</ol>
