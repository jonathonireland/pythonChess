This game was started from this Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-e0jk4I938&t=7481s

Currently working to complete that video's complete progress before moving toward the next one which will be this Youtube video:

I am going to keep moving forward on this as much as time allows. 
Thanks!

Current bugs (moves-list-branch):

1. List of moves displays text and then disappears.
2. Want to display each move as it happens through the game.


Current bugs (Master): 
1. white king flickers as if it's in check even if it isn't (once the in check attack is thwarted).


Development plans:
1. connect pygame to mysql
2. save each game to a games table
3. save each moves made list to a moves_made table.
4. make game more interactive to animate a previous game saved in database.
